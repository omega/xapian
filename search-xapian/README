Search::Xapian version 1.2.4.1
==============================

This is Search::Xapian, a Perl XS frontend to the Xapian C++ search library.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

By default, Makefile.PL looks for xapian-config on your PATH.  You can specify
a path for xapian-config by passing XAPIAN_CONFIG=/path/to/xapian-config on
the command line after Makefile.PL.  Similarly, you can specify a C++ compiler
by passing CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++ after Makefile.PL, as well as CXXFLAGS and
CPPFLAGS to add additional compiler flags.  For example:

   perl Makefile.PL XAPIAN_CONFIG=/home/jim/bin/xapian-config CXX=g++-4.3

These values are stored in the generated Makefile and will be used if "make"
causes "perl Makefile.PL" to be automatically rerun (e.g. if you modify
Makefile.PL).

(For compatibility with what Search::Xapian 1.0.3.0 and earlier required,
XAPIAN_CONFIG and CXX can also be specified as environmental variables.
Specifying them on the command line is preferred because it avoids issues
with differing syntax between shells and having to export variables).

DEPENDENCIES

Search::Xapian currently requires Perl >= 5.6.  To work well in a threaded
Perl script (i.e. when "use threads;" is in use), Perl >= 5.8.7 is required.

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  The Xapian C++ search library, which can be downloaded by following
